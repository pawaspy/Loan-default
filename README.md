# Loan Default Prediction :

This is a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting loan defaults using data from the Lending Club. It covers all stages of a typical machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning and exploration, through model training and evaluation, to hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview :

The project aims to build a model that can predict whether a loan will default, based on various features such as the borrower's financial history, loan details, and credit score. We compare multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and evaluate them using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Getting Started :

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed in your environment. You'll also need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

- ### Dataset :
 Dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle official site : `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club`

### Installation

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/pawaspy/loan-default-prediction.git`

Move into the project directory:

`cd loan-default-prediction`

Install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Structure :

`. ├── data │ └── loan.csv ├── Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb ├── README.md └── requirements.txt`

- `data/loan.csv`: The dataset used for this project.
- `Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project and instructions on how to run the code.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of python libraries required to run the project.

## Usage :

Open the `Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VSCode and run the cells to go through the data analysis and machine learning process.

## Results and Insights :

The performance of the models and insights derived from the analysis are discussed in detail in the Jupyter notebook.
